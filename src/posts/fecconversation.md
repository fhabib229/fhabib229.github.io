#Overview
For our Front-End Capstone Project we decided to build an item-detail page from Twitch.tv. Our goal is to render a Twitch streamer’s video, chat, profile, and categorical videos to the page.

The hardest challenge so far has been the time constraint in attempting to deliver the requirements for each deadline in the deliverables tracker. Some of the strategies I’ve used to help with this are:

  - **Reducing the number of new tools I would like to try.** Going in I was hoping to use new tools I’ve been curious about like GraphQL and Yarn, but there was very little time to research new tools so I decided to forgo the use of these.
  - **Focusing on as much necessary functionality as possible, but no more.** The goal is to try to make this project as realistic to the Real Twitch item-detail page as possible, but in the effort to deliver everything in a timely manner some features had to be removed, like deciding to only render videos that were previously broadcasted, not live broadcasts.
  - **Organizing every task into a ticket.** We used Trello to put every task we needed to accomplish for this project into ticket, following the Agile methodology. This has been helpful in staying on track to meet the deliverable deadlines.
  - **Checking in with teammates.** While most of this project is solo-work it’s necessary to check in on each other to make sure we’re at a similar pace or are able to help each other out when we’re not.
