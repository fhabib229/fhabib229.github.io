## Hi there

My name is Faris Habib.
I've recently completed a 9 month, intense, software engineering immersive with Hack Reactor, based in San Francisco.

I love the process of solving problems by embracing innovation. When components come together and an application begins to take shape, seeing the product take huge leaps forward is a thrill.

Currently I live in Seattle, Washington, a city where there are never too many mountains to explore. In the fall I'm planning to move down to Los Angeles, California.

In my free time I enjoy reading, backpacking, gaming, weightlifting, concerts, and watching corny adventure movies.
