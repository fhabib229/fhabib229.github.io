## Hi there

My name is Faris Habib. I enjoy coding for how you can virtually build anything without needing to worry about the cost of replication. I have an unstoppable curiosity for understanding how things work to improve lives. I believe that communication and dedication are essential to grow as an engineer and I enjoy collaborating with my teammates to ensure our clientsâ€™ problems are solved.

In my free time I enjoy working out, hiking, scuba diving, reading, concerts, and gaming.
