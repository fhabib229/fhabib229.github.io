## Hi there

My name is Faris Habib.  Iâ€™ve been coding for 2-3 years and recently I completed a 9 month, intense, software engineering immersive with Hack Reactor, based in San Francisco.

I love the process of solving problems by coming up with new innovations. I also enjoy coding for how you can virtually build anything without needing to worry about the cost of replication.

Currently I live in Seattle, Washington, a city where there are never too many mountains to explore. In the fall I'm planning to move down to Los Angeles, California.

In my free time I enjoy reading, backpacking, gaming, weightlifting, concerts, and watching corny adventure movies.
